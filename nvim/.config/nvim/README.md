## Neovim Configuration

This is a modular take on a Neovim configuration, largely copied from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

I have made my own tweaks and adjustments, mostly to support combining Neovim and `tmux` in a combined workflow.

See the `./lua/keymaps.lua` and `options.lua` files to learn more.
